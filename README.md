# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store at BigMart.
This helps the decision makers to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.
Using this model, we will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales. Lightgbm gave the 
best model accuracy of 60% and least absolute error and was therefore used to deploy our model.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to build a predictive model capable of predicting sales of products at the various stores in Big Mart. 

## Dataset Description
| Variable     | Description |
| -----------  | ---: |
|Item_Identifier | Unique product ID|
|Item_Weight | Weight of product|
|Item_Fat_Content | Whether the product is low fat or not|
|Item_Visibility | The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product|
|Item_Type | The category to which the product belongs|
|Item_MRP | Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product|
|Outlet_Identifier | Unique store ID|
|Outlet_Establishment_Year|The year in which store was established|
|Outlet_Size|The size of the store in terms of ground area covered|
|Outlet_Location_Type|The type of city in which the store is located|
|Outlet_Type|Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket|
|Item_Outlet_Sales|Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.|
